This repo will guide you on how to make helm chart repo


### Introduction

Helm 3 release on Wed, Nov 13, 2019

Helm 2 used ConfigMaps to store release information. In Helm 3, Secrets are used instead (with a secret type of helm.sh/release) as the default storage driver. This brings a few advantages and has greatly simplified the functionality of Helm.

### In this repo, we will using github page example to host helm chart

```sh
Github Pages example

In a similar way you can create charts repository using GitHub Pages.

GitHub allows you to serve static web pages in two different ways:

    By configuring a project to serve the contents of its docs/ directory
    By configuring a project to serve a particular branch

Weâ€™ll take the second approach, though the first is just as easy.

The first step will be to create your gh-pages branch. You can do that locally as.

$ git checkout -b gh-pages

```

- We will have some sample example as well, like dotnet core 3, and loopback application

### Getting started

- Using `Helm Publisher`
- Using Github Action to publish 
- All the charts are store inside `charts`
- `gh-pages` branch
